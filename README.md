# Calcium-iOS

Utility library to merge [SkeletonView](https://github.com/Juanpe/SkeletonView) and
[GRProvider](https://github.com/GoodRequest/GRProvider) together, allowing you to use declarative UITableView
and UICollectionView syntax instead of using delegates and also have fancy animated skeletons in your UI.

Check documentation of both libraries to see how to use each of them.
